# FPSBuiltOnUnity3D

**Proof of Concept – FPS developed on C# / Unity3D**

Software Development First Person Shooter developed on Unity3D. Meant to test C# Software Architecture capabilities, on Clean Architecture Design Patterns and SOLID principles. Concepts Tested and Practiced within this codebase:

- Unity3d Inheritance and execution order pipeline execution on native classes (MonoBehaviour, Actions and Events)

- Tested SceneManager Administrator Class over native Unity3D engine classes, code-driven objects activation through this manager instead of using Unity3d IDE.

- Tested Design Patterns:
  - Factory Method
  - Façade
  - Iterator
  - Strategy

Thanks to PluralSight for 3d Resources and WalkThrough.
